Hi, I'm Pallavi Reddy Gaddam.  I am graduate student in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University. 
Over the past three years I've worked as an open-source software test engineer in Value Momentum, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course. 
I really look forward to working with all of you.
